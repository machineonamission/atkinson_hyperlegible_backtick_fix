# atkinson hyperlegible, now with the backtick (`) !!!!!

atkinson hyperlegible next and mono, by default, do not come with the backtick (`) character. this is an issue, especially for mono where the backtick is commonly used in code.

i used fontforge to copy the backtick from è in mono and ì in next onto the backtick glyph. this should be fine in mono, but in the future, i might want to refine the spacing in next as the backtick in ì isnt perfectly centered
